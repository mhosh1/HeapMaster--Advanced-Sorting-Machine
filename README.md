# HeapMaster: Advanced Sorting Machine

## Overview

HeapMaster: Advanced Sorting Machine, co-authored by Ibrahim Mohamed and Mohamed Hosh, provides an efficient sorting mechanism using a combination of queues and arrays to represent a sorting machine. This project leverages heap sort to maintain the order of elements and ensures a total preorder relation. The implementation includes rigorous testing using JUnit to verify the correctness and robustness of the sorting machine.

## Project Description

This project provides an in-depth implementation of a sorting machine, represented as a queue and an array, utilizing heap sort for efficient element ordering. The primary methods ensure that the elements are maintained in a total preorder relation, and the implementation follows strict mathematical conventions and correspondence.

## Features

- **Heap Sort Implementation**: Efficient sorting using heap properties.
- **Insertion and Extraction Modes**: Supports switching between insertion and extraction modes.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Ensures proper handling of edge cases and invalid inputs.
- **JUnit Testing**: Comprehensive test cases to ensure correctness and robustness of the implementation.

## Getting Started
